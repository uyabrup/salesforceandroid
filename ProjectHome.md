## **demo account login available!** ##
On login menu, you can login to my demo account instead of your account - some users take trouble in logging in due to Salesforce IP address restriction setting. Just check the box and click login button. You can see, event, task, account, contact, opportunity, case and visualforce, and dashboard. Without your own salesforce id, you can see what and how the app works!!
